Report on Corrosion Index Analysis
</h1> 

This project aims to analyze trends in water corrosiveness and streamflow across US water bodies from 1964 to 2016. The study focuses on understanding the potential for corrosion in water distribution systems by examining the Chloride-Sulfate Mass Ratio (CSMR) and Larson Ratio (LR), key indicators of water corrosiveness. Data from 84 river sites, sourced from the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) project, will be utilized to explore seasonal and flow-related variations in CSMR and LR. The research investigates how changes in water composition affect corrosion indices, aiming to connect treatment approaches at water facilities with these indices. By leveraging corrosion index values and streamflow data, the study employs Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) models to identify trends from 1992 to 2012. Understanding these trends provides insights into the implications of corrosion for water distribution systems, supporting improved water management decisions. This data-driven approach ultimately enhances our understanding of water quality and addresses corrosion-related issues in drinking water facilities.
